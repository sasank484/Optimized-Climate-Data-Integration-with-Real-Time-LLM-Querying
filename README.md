# Optimized-Climate-Data-Integration-with-Real-Time-LLM-Querying

This project is a comprehensive suite of Python-based, containerized applications designed to analyze climate and disaster-related data using structured SQLite databases, natural language processing (NLP), and integration with the **ClimateGPT API**. The suite includes four modules: **NOAA Billion Dollar**, **Disaster Dollar**, **ERA5 Monthly Means**, and **EDGAR GHG Emissions**. Each module supports querying specific datasets, processing natural language questions, and delivering human-like responses through a Model Context Protocol (MCP) framework. The system is fully Dockerized for seamless setup, deployment, and scalability.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

- **Docker and Docker Compose**: Required for containerized deployment.
- **Python 3.11 or 3.12**: Optional for local development without Docker.
- **SQLite3**: Included in Docker images.
- **ClimateGPT API Access**: Requires API credentials from Erasmus.AI.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/newsconsole/GMU_DAEN_2025_01_C.git
   cd GMU_DAEN_2025_01_C
   ```

2. **Create `auth.env` for Each Module**:
   Create an `auth.env` file in the root of each module directory (`NOAA_Billion_Dollar`, `Disaster_Dollar`, `ERA5_Monthly_Means`, `GHG_Emissions`) with:
   ```env
   CLIMATEGPT_USERNAME=your_username
   CLIMATEGPT_PASSWORD=your_password
   ```
   or for ERA5 and GHG:
   ```env
   API_USER=your_api_user
   API_KEY=your_api_key
   ```
   Replace placeholders with your ClimateGPT API credentials. These files are gitignored.

3. **Obtain Databases**:
   - Ensure the following SQLite databases are placed in their respective module directories:
     - `NOAA_Billion_Dollar/disaster_data.db`
     - `Disaster_Dollar/disaster_fema_hud.db`
     - `ERA5_Monthly_Means/south_asia_monthly_new.db`
     - `GHG_Emissions/co2_emissions.db`, `methane_emissions.db`, `N2o_emissions.db`, `Flourinated_gas_emissions.db`
   - These may be included in the repository or require download (contact the project maintainer).

## üöÄ Running the Application

### Using Docker (Recommended)

For each module, navigate to its directory and run:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
Then, for client interaction (except NOAA Billion Dollar):
```bash
python client.py  # or era5client.py, EDGARclient.py
```
For NOAA Billion Dollar:
```bash
python new_disaster_c.py
```
To stop:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Without Docker

1. Start the MCP server for the desired module:
   ```bash
   cd NOAA_Billion_Dollar && python server.py
   # or
   cd Disaster_Dollar && python server.py
   # or
   cd ERA5_Monthly_Means && python era5server.py
   # or
   cd GHG_Emissions && python emissions_mcp.py
   ```

2. In a separate terminal, run the client:
   ```bash
   python new_disaster_c.py  # NOAA Billion Dollar
   # or
   python client.py          # Disaster Dollar
   # or
   python era5client.py      # ERA5 Monthly Means
   # or
   python EDGARclient.py     # EDGAR GHG Emissions
   ```

3. Interact via the terminal. Type `exit` to quit.

## üîê Security Notes

- **API Credentials**: Store ClimateGPT credentials in `auth.env` files and ensure they are not committed to the repository.
- **Database Access**: Databases may contain sensitive data; handle them securely and follow project maintainer instructions for access.
